        Barsana is the village where Shrimati Radharani was born and raised — sitting atop four hills
        said to represent the four Vedas. It is one of the most spiritually charged places in all of Braj.
        The town is permeated with a quiet softness — the air itself seems saturated with Radha's grace.
        The famous Lathmar Holi here draws lakhs of pilgrims every year.

    <div class="place-cards">

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Shri Radha Rani Temple (Ladliji Mandir)</h3>
        <p>
          The crowning jewel of Barsana — perched on the highest hill, this red sandstone temple is dedicated
          to Radha Rani, the beloved of Krishna. The climb of 200+ steps is itself a devotional act, and the
          view from the top — of the entire Braj Mandal spread below — is breathtaking.
        </p>
        <p class="tip">The sunrise view from the temple terrace is divine. Visit on Radhaashtami for the grandest celebrations in all of Braj.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Lathmar Holi Ground (Rang Sthal)</h3>
        <p>
          The ground where the legendary Lathmar Holi takes place — men from Nandgaon come playing Krishna,
          and the women of Barsana playfully beat them with wooden sticks (lathis) while they try to shield
          themselves. A joyful, chaotic, and deeply devotional celebration rooted in the Radha-Krishna leelas.
        </p>
        <p class="tip">Lathmar Holi happens one week before the main Holi — check the lunar calendar each year for exact dates.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Maan Mandir</h3>
        <p>
          The temple on the hill of Maan Garh, where Radha Rani expressed her divine maan (loving sulk)
          toward Krishna. A quiet hilltop temple with extraordinary views of the Braj landscape and beautifully
          carved walls. A deeply contemplative space.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Pili Pokhar (Yellow Pond)</h3>
        <p>
          A sacred kund at the base of Barsana's hills — where Radha and her sakhis would come to fetch water.
          The water has a distinctive golden-yellow hue from the local soil. Surrounded by ancient temples and
          trees, it is a serene spot for quiet darshan.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Vrishabhanu Kund</h3>
        <p>
          Named after Radha's father, Vrishabhanu Maharaj — this kund is where the family would bathe.
          An important stop on the Barsana parikrama and a historically significant sacred tank that
          connects to the intimate family life of Radha Rani.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Dan Bihari Temple</h3>
        <p>
          A beloved temple in Barsana's lanes — home to Dan Bihari (Krishna who playfully demanded dan,
          or toll, from Radha's party as they carried pots of milk and curd along the mountain path).
          The playful stories of this leela come alive here in the local bhajans.
