        Nandgaon is the village of Nanda Maharaj — the foster father who raised Krishna with Yashoda Maiya
        in the pastoral bliss of the Braj countryside. Located on a hill just 8 km from Barsana, Nandgaon is
        forever connected to Barsana through the playful rivalry of their Lathmar Holi — Krishna's boys versus
        Radha's girls. The hill, the temple, and the surrounding fields carry a deep rural warmth.

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Nanda Bhavan Mandir (Nand Ji Temple)</h3>
        <p>
          The magnificent hilltop temple of Nandgaon — housing deities of Nanda Maharaj, Yashoda Maiya,
          Balaram, and Bal Krishna. The view from the hilltop — particularly toward Barsana in the distance —
          is magical and deeply evocative of the Braj countryside that Krishna called home.
        </p>
        <p class="tip">Climb the hill in early morning when it's cool and the light falls golden on the plains below.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Lathmar Holi — Nandgaon Style</h3>
        <p>
          The men of Nandgaon go to Barsana one day and get playfully beaten with lathis. The following day,
          Barsana's women come to Nandgaon and the roles reverse. The entire Nandgaon erupts in colour, bhajans,
          and joyful chaos. The Nand Ji temple becomes the epicentre of celebrations.
        </p>
        <p class="tip">Nandgaon's Holi is slightly less crowded than Barsana — a better choice for those who want a more immersive experience.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Pavana Sarovar</h3>
        <p>
          A sacred lake connected to Nanda Maharaj's daily devotion — he would bathe here and offer prayers
          toward the Yamuna. A peaceful, contemplative kund surrounded by old temples and trees — much less
          visited and deeply serene.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Uddhava Kyari</h3>
        <p>
          The garden where Uddhava — Krishna's dear friend and messenger — came to deliver Krishna's message
          to the gopis and residents of Vraja. The gopis' response to Uddhava became the famous "Bhramara Geet"
          (Song of the Bumblebee) — one of the most beautiful passages in the entire Bhagavatam.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Ter Kadamb</h3>
        <p>
          A Kadamba tree atop a hill near Nandgaon where Krishna would climb and call his cows home with his
          flute in the evenings. The site retains an extraordinary pastoral silence — listening to the wind here,
          you can almost hear the flute echoing across the Braj plains.
