        Mathura is one of the seven sacred cities of Hinduism and the birthplace of Bhagwan Shri Krishna.
        Located on the banks of the Yamuna, this ancient city has been a centre of devotion and spirituality
        for over 5,000 years. To walk its streets is to walk in the footsteps of the divine.

    <div class="place-cards">

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi</h3>
        <p>
          The holiest site in Mathura — the exact prison cell where Devaki gave birth to Krishna at midnight.
          The temple complex houses the original Garbhagriha (the prison room) with the deity of Bal Krishna.
          A powerful and deeply moving site.
        </p>
        <p class="tip">Visit during Janmashtami for the midnight abhishek — one of the most electrifying spiritual experiences in all of Braj.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Vishram Ghat</h3>
        <p>
          The most sacred ghat in Mathura, where Krishna rested after slaying Kansa.
          Morning and evening aartis here are spectacular — dozens of oil lamps float on the Yamuna.
          A series of 25 ghats stretches along this sacred riverbank.
        </p>
        <p class="tip">Arrive for the evening Yamuna aarti at sunset — the sight of hundreds of lamps on the river is unforgettable.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Dwarkadhish Mandir</h3>
        <p>
          A magnificent temple built in 1814, dedicated to Dwarkadhish (Krishna as King of Dwarka).
          Known for its beautiful Rajasthani-style carvings and daily utsav — the deity is dressed in
          different outfits multiple times a day.
        </p>
        <p class="tip">The Shringar darshan is very special — arrive early as queues grow long through the day.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Kans Qila (Kansa's Fort)</h3>
        <p>
          The legendary fort of the tyrant Kansa, Krishna's maternal uncle. The fort sits on the banks
          of the Yamuna. Though much of it has weathered over time, the site carries immense mythological
          significance as the backdrop for Krishna's divine mission of liberation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Mathura Government Museum</h3>
        <p>
          Houses one of India's finest collections of Mathura School sculpture — including iconic Buddha
          and Krishna images carved in red sandstone. A must-visit for art and history lovers.
        </p>
        <p class="tip">Don't miss the Kushana-period sculptures — they are considered world-class.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Potara Kund</h3>
        <p>
          The sacred kund where baby Krishna's clothes were washed. A serene, lesser-visited spot that
          resonates with tender maternal devotion — a quiet contrast to the busier sites nearby.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Birla Mandir (Gita Mandir)</h3>
        <p>
          A beautiful marble temple complex featuring all 18 chapters of the Bhagavad Gita engraved on
          its pillars. Peaceful, clean, and perfect for quiet contemplation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>What to Taste — Mathura Peda</h3>
        <p>
          Mathura's most famous sweet — milk-based, crumbly, lightly spiced pedas. Offered as prasad
          across all temples. Brijwasi Sweets near Vishram Ghat is considered one of the best in town.
          Also try the classic kachori-sabzi breakfast from the ghat-side stalls.
