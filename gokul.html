      <p>
        Gokul is where newborn Krishna was secretly carried by his father Vasudeva across the flooded Yamuna
        on that stormy Janmashtami night — and placed in the care of Nanda and Yashoda. It is here that
        Krishna spent his earliest years as Bal Gopal — crawling in the dust, stealing butter, and hiding in
        Yashoda's lap. The town retains a quiet, village-like sanctity that feels truly timeless.

    <h2 class="section-title">Must-Visit Places in Gokul</h2>

    <div class="place-cards">

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Nanda Bhavan</h3>
        <p>
          The home of Nanda Maharaj and Mother Yashoda — where Krishna was raised as their son. The site has
          a beautiful temple with Bal Krishna's darshan. The courtyard evokes the image of baby Krishna
          crawling between the grinding stones, butter pots on high shelves, and Yashoda chasing the little
          thief with a rope.
        </p>
        <p class="tip">The deity of Bal Gopal here is especially tender — a favourite for devotees who see Krishna as their own child.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Brahmanda Ghat</h3>
        <p>
          The sacred ghat where the Brahmanda leela occurred — young Krishna ate mud, and when Yashoda asked
          him to open his mouth, she saw the entire universe within. A deeply philosophical leela made visible
          in the simplest act of childhood. Evening aarti here is serene.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Yashoda Kund</h3>
        <p>
          The sacred kund where Yashoda bathed baby Krishna. Near here is also the site of the ukhala bandhana
          leela — where Yashoda tied Krishna to the grinding stone, which then dragged along and knocked down
          the twin Yamala-Arjuna trees, liberating two celestial beings trapped within. A tender site.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Vasudeva Crossing Point</h3>
        <p>
          The spot where Vasudeva is believed to have crossed the flooding Yamuna with newborn Krishna on the
          night of Janmashtami — balancing the basket above the raging river while Sheshnag sheltered them
          from the storm. A deeply evocative spot that brings scripture to life.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Raman Reti</h3>
        <p>
          The sacred sandy grounds just outside Gokul where Krishna and Balaram played as children with the
          other cowherds. "Raman Reti" means "sand of joy." Walking barefoot on this sand is considered a
          purifying act — many devotees even roll on it in devotion.
        </p>
        <p class="tip">Remove your footwear and walk slowly in the sand — there is something quietly powerful about this place.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Gokul Chandrama Temple</h3>
        <p>
          A beautiful, peaceful temple on the Yamuna bank dedicated to the combined form of Radha-Krishna
          in their Gokul leelas. Less crowded than the main spots — perfect for quiet darshan and reflection.
