        Govardhan Hill — called Giriraj ("King of Mountains") — is one of the most sacred sites in all of
        Hinduism. Krishna lifted this hill with his little finger to shelter the Brajwasis from Indra's
        torrential wrath. Every stone of Giriraj is worshipped as a form of Krishna himself. The 21-km
        Govardhan Parikrama is among the most powerful devotional acts a pilgrim can undertake in Braj.

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Govardhan Hill (Giriraj)</h3>
        <p>
          Giriraj Govardhan is worshipped as a directly manifested form of Krishna. Every stone on the hill is
          offered milk, water, and flowers by devotees. The hill is said to be slowly sinking into the earth —
          a few centimetres every hundred years — as it patiently awaits reunion with the divine.
        </p>
        <p class="tip">Pick up a small stone from the ground (not from the hill) as prasad — called "Giriraj shila" — a sacred memento of your visit.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Radha Kund &amp; Shyam Kund</h3>
        <p>
          The two most sacred kunds in all of Braj. Radha Kund was created by Radha Rani herself; Shyam Kund
          was created by Krishna. Bathing here on Bahula Ashtami (Kartik month) is considered the highest
          spiritual act in all of Braj. Even sitting quietly at the edge at dawn is profoundly moving.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Mukharavind</h3>
        <p>
          The most important temple on the Govardhan parikrama — Mukharavind is the "face" (mukha) of Giriraj,
          a natural indentation in the hill that resembles a face. Thousands of pilgrims offer milk, flowers,
          and full-body prostrations here every single day.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Mansi Ganga</h3>
        <p>
          A sacred lake at the heart of Govardhan town — created from Krishna's mind (manas). Krishna wanted
          to bring the Ganga here so the Brajwasis wouldn't need to travel far. Bathing here is considered
          equivalent to bathing in the Ganga. Especially beautiful during Kartik Purnima with floating lamps.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Daan Ghat</h3>
        <p>
          Where Krishna would playfully demand dan (toll/tax) from Radha and the gopis as they carried pots
          of milk and curd. The joyful dialogue between Krishna and Radha at this spot is celebrated in
          countless Braj bhajans. A site filled with leela memory and joy.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Kusum Sarovar</h3>
        <p>
          A stunningly beautiful ornamental stepwell-lake between Govardhan and Radha Kund. Radha would
          gather flowers (kusums) here from the surrounding gardens. The carved ghats and old stone pavilions
          make this one of the most visually magnificent spots in all of Braj.
        </p>
        <p class="tip">Kusum Sarovar at sunset is extraordinary — golden light on the water, lotus blooms, ancient carved stone. Don't miss it.</p>
