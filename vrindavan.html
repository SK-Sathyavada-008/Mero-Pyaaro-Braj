        Vrindavan is the holiest forest-town in the universe of Vaishnava devotion. This is where Krishna
        spent his youth — playing the flute in the kadamba groves, dancing the Maharaas at Seva Kunj, and
        stealing butter in the lanes that still echo his name. Every temple, every kund, every tree here
        is a witness to the eternal love of Radha and Krishna.

    <div class="place-cards">

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>🎶 Banke Bihari Mandir</h3>
        <p>
          The most beloved temple of Vrindavan, housing the deity manifest from Nidhivan by Swami Haridas ji.
          The deity of Banke Bihari is mesmerising — Krishna in his playful three-bent posture with his peacock
          feather. The parda (curtain) is raised and lowered every few seconds during darshan, as the priests
          believe no devotee can bear the full force of his gaze for long.
        </p>
        <p class="tip">The Shringar aarti during Kartik is very special and rare — check timings in advance.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Nidhivan</h3>
        <p>
          A mysterious, sacred grove where the trees are permanently twisted and intertwined. It is believed
          that Radha-Krishna perform their Maharaas here every night. The grove is locked before sunset — no
          one is allowed inside after dark. Even the birds fly away as dusk falls. A profoundly sacred and
          deeply mysterious place.
        </p>
        <p class="tip">Do not enter after sunset — it is strictly forbidden, upheld for centuries. Visit before 5 PM.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Seva Kunj</h3>
        <p>
          The sacred grove where the Maharaas — the divine dance of Krishna with the gopis — is said to have
          taken place. During Sharad Purnima night, this becomes the spiritual centre of all Vrindavan.
          Ancient trees, winding paths, and a deep stillness pervade this space.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Radha Damodar Mandir</h3>
        <p>
          One of Vrindavan's oldest and most scholarly temples, established by Jeeva Goswami — a direct
          disciple of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. The samadhi (tomb) of Rupa Goswami is here. Also the bhajan
          kutir of Srila Prabhupada. A deeply sacred place for all Vaishnavas worldwide.
        </p>
        <p class="tip">Ideal for sitting quietly, reading, or just being in stillness. The atmosphere is unlike anywhere else.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Govind Dev Ji Mandir</h3>
        <p>
          Built in 1590 by Raja Man Singh of Amber — once the tallest temple in Vrindavan with seven stories.
          Aurangzeb demolished the upper floors, but the remaining structure is still magnificent. The Govinda
          deity was installed by Rupa Goswami himself using Krishna's own instructions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Keshi Ghat</h3>
        <p>
          The ghat where Krishna slew the demon Keshi who had taken the form of a terrible horse.
          The Yamuna flows peacefully here today — wide, calm, and golden at sunset. One of the most
          atmospheric and photogenic spots in all of Vrindavan.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Radha Raman Mandir</h3>
        <p>
          Among the most authentic temples in Vrindavan — the deity of Radha Raman manifested from a
          shaligram shila for Gopala Bhatta Goswami. The original deity has been worshipped in an unbroken
          lineage by the same Goswami family since 1542. No replica has ever been made.
        </p>
        <p class="tip">The fragrance of fresh flowers and the simplicity of traditional seva here is unlike anything else in Vrindavan.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Vanshi Vat</h3>
        <p>
          The ancient Kadamba tree on the Yamuna bank where Krishna played his flute. The gopis, upon hearing
          the flute, left everything and came running. This spot marks the beginning of the Maharaas — one of
          the most intimate and reverent places in all of Braj.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>ISKCON Vrindavan (Krishna Balaram Mandir)</h3>
        <p>
          A magnificent white marble temple complex founded by Srila Prabhupada, with deities of
          Krishna-Balaram, Radha-Shyamasundar, and Gaura-Nitai. The evening Gaura aarti is one of the
          most joyful spiritual events in Vrindavan — the entire hall erupts in kirtan.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Madan Mohan Mandir</h3>
        <p>
          Vrindavan's oldest and most historically significant temple, perched on a small hill overlooking
          the Yamuna. The deity was installed by Sanatana Goswami. The setting — with peacocks, the Yamuna
          glittering below, and the sound of bells — is dreamlike.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="place-card">
        <h3>Prem Mandir</h3>
        <p>
          A breathtaking white marble temple built by Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj, completed in 2012.
          The entire structure is carved from Italian marble with intricate scenes of Krishna's leelas covering
          every wall and pillar. At night, the temple is lit up in changing colours — making it one of the most
          visually stunning sights in all of Vrindavan.
        </p>
        <p class="tip">Visit after sunset for the light-and-colour display — the illuminated marble glows beautifully against the dark sky.</p>
